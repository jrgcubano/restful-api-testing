I would like to thank everyone who supported me in any way during my work. Specifically the team of people from Apiary without which the work would probably continue since a certain moment to a completely different direction. I would also like to thank my supervisor Ing. Jaroslav Kuchař for his patience and forbearance during my work. I must not omit Tomáš and Filip who helped me find some mistakes in English. Although there is still a lot of them definitely remaining. Last but not least I thank my girlfriend who supported me and left alone to work with understanding, even whole nights sometimes. At the end I thank all colleagues and friends who supported me when I was losing hope that I will ever complete this thesis.

I hope that this work will bring at least a little bit of new knowledge to someone like me. I also hope that the resulting tool will be useful in many real projects.
